### How to start

2. **Create a branch** off your own fork of the repository.
3. **Submit your proposed changes** in a merge request targeting `dev` branch.
4. **The core team will review** and decide whether to merge.

## Join the core team ü§ù
The Library OS team is organized by @dillonfagan, member of the Steering Committee at [PVD Things](https://www.pvdthings.coop/) in Providence, Rhode Island.

We meet **Tuesdays at 7:30 PM (New York Time)** on Discord, though this may change depending on the preferences of the team.

We work using agile-inspired methodologies and believe in things like SOLID, red-green refactoring, and intuitive design.
